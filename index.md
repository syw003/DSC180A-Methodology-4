**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
One interesting thing that was covered in our domain was using RAG to leverage our predictive AI models to build better resposes and results from our generative AI models. RAG is a new topic that I'm unfamiliar with and I think it's a really good way to target issues that I frequently face while using generative AI models today, where there tends to be a lot of issues with hallucinations and non updated sources that are used to generate responses.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Maybe working on a personalized credibility assistant, like a plug in that interacts with users daily and automatically detects factuality in news and social media posts that the user is reading and interacting with, providing real time results so that users can know how true something is while reading it, rather than having to do extra work to fact check something or do more research on it.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Maybe find ways to better evaluate or improve our predictive models. I think some of them are good and some are alright, but it would be better if our predictive models were all more solid and performed better.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I know that in the future we will be integrating agentic AI in our project, maybe some other things we can try are implementing memory-based agents because I think that might be helpful in this context, since it's doing one consistent task it can learn from previous tasks over time and hopefully improve consistency over time.
